## The Stream Team
---
###Philosophy
---
The Stream Team is a passion project started by Janel Brandon to have fun while coding. The idea is that as a senior dev with 20 years experience she will stream code-alongs on Twitch with a mid-range, Carlie Hamilton, and junior dev, Cat Stevens.

Our main philosophy is that it has to be fun. If we entertain or inspire along the way that will add to our enjoyment

### Projects
---

We will code various things here, such as:
 
- Hackerrank challenges
- Making bots for twitch
- Bigger projects over a number of weeks

Before you ask - YES! we are looking for ideas. If you have a small project or challenge you are stuck on, add it to our suggestion box and we might get to it.
