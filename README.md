## Philosophy
---
The Stream Team is a passion project all about having some fun while coding. The idea is that Janel, a senior dev with over 20 years experience will stream code-alongs on Twitch with a mid-level, Carlie, and junior, Cat.

Our main philosophy is that it has to be fun. If we entertain or inspire along the way that will add to our enjoyment.

## Projects
---

We will code various things here, such as:
 
- Hackerrank challenges
- Making bots for twitch
- Bigger projects over a number of weeks
- Maybe some TDD (I know this one doesn't *sound* like fun, but nothing makes us smile more than well written codes in an existing code base)
